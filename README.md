# Event Management Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a web-based Event Management Dashboard designed to streamline the organization and management of events. It allows users to create, manage, and track events, attendees, and tasks efficiently. Built as part of a hackathon assignment, this dashboard integrates a user-friendly frontend, a robust backend, and a database for storing event-related data.

## Features
### Event Management
- Create, update, delete, and view events.
- Display event details including name, description, location, and date.

### Attendee Management
- Add and remove attendees.
- Assign attendees to specific events or tasks.

### Task Tracker
- Track task progress with statuses (Pending/Completed).
- Visualize task progress with a progress bar.

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
